# Playing-With-Ajax

Created a site to play around with Ajax and API's. Getting information from other sites and using it seems like an
important part of development. This likely will be an ongoing project as I have time.

Currently, there are some different mini-apps, for lack of better term, that use the Flickr API. In one, you can search
for anything and get back photos from flickr for that search. In another, I have used a couple of groups that load photos
of just letters and just numbers to create photos from text given. So if you were to type in "I want 1 million dollars" you
would get back pictures similar to a ransom note.

I also played around with a weather API. You can enter your city and state, or your zip code and get back the current weather
as well as a forecast. 

As I have also recently discovered the fun of using bootstrap, I also incorporated that into the site to make things quick and
easy.
